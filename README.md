**Proud Project/Task:**
One project I'm particularly proud of was developing a strategic marketing plan for Elliano’s, a local coffee business in Valdosta, as part of my marketing capstone course. The project involved conducting market research, analyzing the company’s current positioning, and proposing targeted strategies to improve customer engagement and brand visibility. What made this experience stand out was the opportunity to apply classroom concepts to a real-world business and see the tangible impact of our recommendations. It gave me valuable experience in strategic thinking, collaboration, and client-focused problem-solving.
